# NextBot

This was a quick hack to attempt to get a beta invite to Basecamp Next. The code
should be fairly self-explanitory. It's a Twitter bot...

## Dependencies

A simple `$ npm install` should take care of the package dependencies. Other
than that, you'll need to set the following environment variables:

    CONSUMER_KEY
    CONSUMER_SECRET
    ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
    SUBDOMAIN

## License

The "do whatever the hell you want to" license.
